Active Learning: Usinng colspan and rowspan

1. First, make a local copy of our animals-table.html and minimal-table.css files in a new directory on your local machine. The HTML contains the same animals example as you saw above.

2. Next, use colspan to make "Animals", "Hippopotamus", and "Crocodile" span across two columns.

3. Finally, use rowspan to make "Horse" and "Chicken" span across two rows.
   Save and open your code in a browser to see the improvement.
